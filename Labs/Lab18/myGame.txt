"SampleGame" by Pruthvi

Use no scoring.

When play begins:
say "Your name is Roger, an avid gamer. After playing a lot of games last night you went to sleep really late. You have just woken up".
The Bedroom is a room. "The wall has posters of different games all over it!".

The PS4 is in the room. "It's a dark colored console. There are a lot different game CDs next to it. You feel tempted to play more but decide to go down".

The clock is in the room. "It's a white colored analog watch on the wall. You check there to see what time is it and realize that you have woken up late.... again".

The time of day is 2:00 pm.

 


At 2:05 PM:
Say "You hear some noise in the kitchen, so you go down to see what's going on.".

Now you are in the kitchen.

The kitchen is a room. "It's a big kitchen with a kitchen island. There are lot of foods in the fridge. Your favouirate food is cheeseburger".
The kitchen is north of the Bedroom.
The fridge is in the kitchen. "It's a big fridge with lot's of stuff in it.".

Mom is in the kitchen. "Mom is caring and always helps you.". Mom is a woman.
Dad is in the kitchen. "Dad is always angry at you for waking up late." Dad is a man.

Instead of examining the fridge, say "You woke up late again, so dad is furious with you. Mom tries to defend you but it goes in vain.".

Instead of examining Dad:
say "You are terrified of the situation so you go back to your room and start playing some games".
