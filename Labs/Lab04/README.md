# CS152 SJSU

Wrote a function that given a list of numbers, produces the sum of their squares using foldr, not recursion.

Repeated with foldl as well.

Using foldl, combined a list of strings into a single string, separated by the specified separator. 

Wrote a function that makes matching open and close tags, using the list of tag-names
