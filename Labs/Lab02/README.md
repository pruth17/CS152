# CS152 SJSU

Implemented a reverse function that reverses the order of a list.
e.g. (reverse '(1 2 3 4)) -> '(4 3 2 1)

Implemented an add-two-lists function that combines two lists into a new list where the items have been added together. If the lists are not the same size, return the additional elements of the longer list.
e.g. (add-two-lists '(1 2 3 4) '(3 2 1)) -> '(4 4 4 4)

Implemented a positive-nums-only method that takes a list and returns only those items that are greater than 0.
e.g. (positive-nums-only '(3 -4 2 0 -1)) -> '(3 2)
