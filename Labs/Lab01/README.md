# CS152 SJSU

Part 1) Implement a maxNum function.  This function reads in a list of numbers and returns the largest. Define this function in a recursive manner.


Part 2) Implement the "fizzbuzz" game.  The function counts from 1 to the specified number, returning a string with the result.  The rules are:


    If a number is divisible by 3 and by 5, instead say "fizzbuzz"
    Else if a number is divisible by 3, instead say "fizz"
    Else if a number is divisible by 5, instead say "buzz"
    Otherwise say the number
